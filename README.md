# Web Components

A selection of responsive web components, made with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, all in a single page:
* A personalized navbar that will show a username typed in the prompt;
* A page theme selector that will load a different stylesheet according to the choice made in the dropdown menu;
* A text-revealing button that will alternatively hide or show a piece of text when pressed;
* A framed image loader where the user can input a URL for an image, and also change the image frame color and width;
* A gallery that will change the image upon clicking or by pressing any key.
